In the world of trading, detecting Pre-arranged trading is very hard to detect and mirror trading is one them.
The trading effectively act as a mechanism for moving money from one customer to another. 
A customer engages in prearraged or other non-competitive securities trading, including washing or cross trades.
Challange to detect such fraud is with the high volume of data comming every day, as well as each customer is required to compare with each customer on there trading pattern that too focus on multiple days of trading.

### Financial-Models-Numerical-Methods

This is just a collection of topics and algorithms that in my opinion are interesting.

It contains several topics that are not so popular nowadays, but that can be very powerful. Usually, topics such as PDE methods, LÃ©vy processes, Fourier methods or Kalman filter are not very popular among practitioners, who prefers to work with more standard tools.
The aim of these notebooks is to present these interesting topics, by showing their practical application through an interactive python implementation.
